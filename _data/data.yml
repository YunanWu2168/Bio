          Developed a cheaper and easier-to-use technology that can compete with expensive devices by providing researchers with physiological signals from sensors to measure users' cognitive and emotional workload in real-time as they are engaged in a task. Details included:
            - Collected biometric measurements from Emotibit and Empatica E4 along with established EEG measurements from Emotiv.
            - Built Machine Learning models to map physiological signals to cognitive and emotional scores of excitement, focus, engagement and stress. 
            - Submitted a conference paper to ACM CHI2023 (under review).
